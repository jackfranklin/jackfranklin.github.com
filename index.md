# Work and Open Source

###The JavaScript Playground
I run the popular [JavaScript Playground](http://javascriptplayground.com) blog, on which I write tutorials about a variety of JavaScript topics including ES6, Gulp, Node and more.

###gulp-load-plugins
[gulp-load-plugins](http://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins) is a Gulp plugin that makes it really easy to add and use other Gulp plugins in your project. It averages over 100,000 installs a day on npm.

###Beginning jQuery
My first physical book, [Beginning jQuery](http://www.apress.com/9781430249320) was published in February 2013. I was approached to write the book in June 2012, and seven months later it's about to be released. The book aims to guide a JavaScript and jQuery novice through to a level at which they are comfortable in writing their own plugins.

###Net magazine
Since mid 2012 I have been a regular writer for .Net, the largest web development magazine in the UK. I wrote the JavaScript gallery section for a number of months and on JavaScript topics, including a recent cover feature on JavaScript libraries.

###"Backbone Fundamentals" RequireJS Chapter
I was asked by Addy Osmani to contribute to his [Backbone Fundamentals](http://addyosmani.github.com/backbone-fundamentals/) book, a book published by O'Reilly but freely available on the internet too. I helped write the chapter on using Backbone with RequireJS.

###TIL: Vim
A small Jekyll powered blog, [TIL Vim](http://tilvim.com/) documents things I learn about the Vim editor.

### pulldown
[pulldown](https://github.com/jackfranklin/pulldown) is a small npm module for quickly downloading libraries via the command line.

You can find many more projects [on Github](http://github.com/jackfranklin).
