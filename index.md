# Projects

###Beginning jQuery
My first physical book, [Beginning jQuery](http://www.apress.com/9781430249320) was published in February 2013. I was approached to write the book in June 2012, and seven months later it's about to be released. The book aims to guide a JavaScript and jQuery novice through to a level at which they are comfortable in writing their own plugins.

###The JavaScript Playground
I run the popular [JavaScript Playground](http://javascriptplayground.com), which received over 250,000 page views in its first 9 months of existance. On it I cover a range of JavaScript and jQuery subjects with short, concise tutorials.

###Testing with CoffeeScript
My first book, [Testing with CoffeeScript](https://efendibooks.com/minibooks/testing-with-coffeescript) was published as a free "mini book". It has had over 2,000 downloads to date. The book looks at TDD with the JS library Jasmine, whilst writing all the code in CoffeeScript.

###.Net magazine
Since mid 2012 I have been a regular writer for .Net, the largest web development magazine in the UK. I write the JavaScript gallery section every month and have written for the website too, on subjects such as [MV* Frameworks](http://www.netmagazine.com/features/essential-javascript-top-five-mvc-frameworks).

###"Backbone Fundamentals" RequireJS Chapter
I was asked by Addy Osmani to contribute to his [Backbone Fundamentals](http://addyosmani.github.com/backbone-fundamentals/) book, a book published by O'Reilly but freely available on the internet too. I helped write the chapter on using Backbone with RequireJS.

###TIL: Vim
A small Jekyll powered blog, [TIL Vim](http://tilvim.com/) documents things I learn about the Vim editor.

### pulldown
[pulldown](https://github.com/jackfranklin/pulldown) is a small npm module for quickly downloading libraries via the command line.

You can find many more projects [on Github](http://github.com/jackfranklin).
