title: "Building an App with Express and Backbone: Part 2"
---

<p>In the <a href="http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2013/02/express-backbone-application-part1">first part of the series</a> we created our ExpressJS app and served up all the books from our Mongo database. Today we'll accomplish the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Refactor our /books URL into the routes/index.js file</li>
<li>Move our database code into its own module</li>
<li>Set up a route to serve up an individual book's JSON</li>
<li>Learn about Mongo's ObjectID</li>
</ul>

<p>Apologies for the slightly duller and quieter voice this time around - illness and a cold have played their part!</p>

	As always the <a href="https://github.com/javascript-playground/express-backbone-library-app">code is on Github</a>, and I highly recommend playing the video in HD so it's clearer to see (I record at my laptop's resolution so everything should be crystal clear).</p>

<p>If you have any questions, leave a comment and I'll either reply with a comment or answer in the next video.</p>
