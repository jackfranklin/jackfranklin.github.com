Today I'll pick off where [Part 1](http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2012/04/node-js-a-todo-app-with-express) left off, and start working on the to-do part of our application. This tutorial literally starts where Part 1 stops, so if you haven't read Part 1 or need a refresher, I highly recommend reading that before this.

_Note: this tutorial uses Express 2.5.8. Currently Express V3 is in beta. Once Express 3 stable is released, I will run a post discussing updating to it and link to it here. In the mean time, if you're using Express 3, a few things might be different to this tutorial. None-the-less, there's still a lot here that you can learn from, I hope_.

The first thing I'm going to do is create a new view for our Todo screen. This will list our todos and also provide a form for adding new ones. Create the file `views/todo.jade` and add something like this:

    h1 new todo list
    form(action="/save", method="post")
      p
        label Enter a new todo item
        input(type='text',placeholder='new todo', name='todo-text')
      p
        input(type='submit', value='Save')

And then we need to add the route for this, so the user sees this view when they go to `/todo`.

Head into `route/routes.js`:

    exports.todo = function(req, res){
      res.render('todo', {
      	title: 'New Todo List'
      });
    };

And finally we just need to link this route up to our URL, which is done at the bottom of `app.js` (which you may have renamed to `server.js`, as per the previous tutorial):

    app.get('/todo', routes.todo);

If you're not already, run our server with `nodemon app.js`. If you haven't got nodemon installed, please see the previous tutorial.

Now, if you visit `http://localhost:3000/todo`, you should see something like this:

Lets build in the functionality for listing some todo items. Obviously at the minute we don't have any of them, so I'll add some fake ones in. When you render a view, you can pass in variables, as we did above to set `title`. Lets pass in an array of objects into the view to represent our items. For now they will be pretty simple:

    h1 new todo list
    form(action="/save", method="post")
      p
        label Enter a new todo item
        input(type='text',placeholder='new todo', name='todo-text')
      p
        input(type='submit', value='Save')
    ul
      each todo in todos
        li #{todo.text}

Now we can make use of Jade's built in looping mechanism to loop through our array. It's really beautifully simple:

    ul
    	each todo in todos
    	  li #{todo.text}

All I do here is create a new unordered list, and for each item within the `todos` array (which I passed in above), just output the text.

And now our view looks like so:

It's now time to actually implement the adding of new todos.

The first question is how to store our items? I'm going to use [Redis](http://redis.io/). There's good documentation out there on how to install it, so I wont go through that here. One thing I will mention is if you're on Mac & use Homebrew, by far and away the easiest install is through this, using `brew install redis`.

Then we need the NPM Package for Redis, which you can install locally with:

    npm install redis --save

Remember, doing `--save` will add it as a dependency to your `package.json` file.

Now, within the file where we're going to be using Redis, which for us will be exclusively `routes/routes.js`. You might be thinking it seems a bit messy to put it in here - and you'd be right. In a future tutorial I will show you how I'd tidy this up, but for now I want to concentrate purely on the Redis functionality.

So, within your routes file, add in this code:

    var redis = require("redis"),
        client = redis.createClient();

You'll also need to make sure a Redis instance is running on your machine. Try typing `redis-cli` in the command line to see if it's running. On the Mac, to run the server you can type:

    redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf

Redis is a key-value datastore that's lightening quick & perfect for our needs here. Redis can be used with lots of datatypes but the most common use is a hash, where we store objects.

Firstly, lets link up our form. Add this line to `app.js`:

    app.post('/save', routes.saveTodo);

And add the function to handle this route (don't panic, I'll explain the code in a second):

    exports.saveTodo = function(req, res) {
      var newTodo = {};
      newTodo.name = req.body['todo-text'];
      newTodo.id = newTodo.name.replace(" ", "-");
      client.hset("Todo", newTodo.id, newTodo.name);
      res.redirect("back");
    };

All I do here is create a new object to store our new todo. I can get at the post data through `req.body['todo-text']` - remember I gave our form field a name of that. Each item that is stored in Redis needs an id attached to it, which has to be unique. A simple way to do this in this instance is to generate the ID based on the name, but replacing spaces with `"-"`, which is what I do to generate the ID using `replace(" ", "-")`.

Finally, once I have my new Todo object, I use the `hset` method (because we're storing a hash, hence the "h"), passing in a key which acts as the name of the datastore, and then I pass in the id & name as new parameters.

Once that's done, I want to pass the user back to the main `todo` page, so I can redirect the user back to where they came from, which would have been the main todo page.

Once that's done, we need to edit `exports.todo` to get the todo items from the data store. To get data from Redis, I can use `hgetall` (again, the "h" denoting hash). This takes two arguments, the key (which for us is "Todo") and a function to process the data. All I do here is loop through & store the new items into an array.

    exports.todo = function(req, res){
      var todos = [];
      client.hgetall("Todo", function(err, objs) {
        for(var k in objs) {
          var newTodo = {
            text: objs[k]
          };
          todos.push(newTodo);
        }
        res.render('todo', {
          title: 'New Todo List',
          todos: todos
        });
      });
    };

The key thing to note here is that the call to `res.render` is now **inside** the `hgetall` function. This is down to the asynchronous nature of Redis, you need to call the `render` only once you know you've got your data. It's much the same as when you're working with data fetched from an Ajax call. Once we do have our `todos` array, I can pass that into the view.

Now I can go in and add something, and then I'm immediately taken back to the same page, with that item added.

In summary, we've covered a lot today, the main focus being using Redis but we've also explored Jade further & done more with Express.

As always, if you have any questions please leave a comment & the code from this tutorial is [available on Github](https://github.com/jackfranklin/node-todo).

In the coming parts I'd like to look at tidying up this code - perhaps abstracing all the Todo functionality out into an individual file - and then look at testing that file.
