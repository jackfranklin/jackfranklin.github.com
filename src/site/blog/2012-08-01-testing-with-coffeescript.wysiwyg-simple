<p>
	I am very excited to announce that my first published book is now available to download! I&#39;m lucky enough to be the inaugural writer for the <a href="https://efendibooks.com/minibooks">Efendi MiniBooks</a> range.</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://efendibooks.com/minibooks/testing-with-coffeescript">Testing With CoffeeScript</a> is a short, sweet and pragmatic guide to writing complex web applications using CoffeeScript and Behaviour-driven Development (BDD). We&#39;ll delve into Jasmine, the core concepts of TDD/BDD and how it all integrates with CoffeeScript. We&#39;ll build a simple shopping cart system; showing us how to use CoffeeScript and Jasmine in tandem and how it&#39;ll help us create more robust applications.</p>
<p>
	Testing with CoffeeScript is totally and utterly free to download, and available on <a href="https://efendibooks.com">the Efendi site</a>.</p>
