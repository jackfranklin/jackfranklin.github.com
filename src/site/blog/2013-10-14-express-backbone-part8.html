title: "Building an App with Express and Backbone: Part 8"
intro: Today we introduce some structure with RequireJS.
---

<p>In this episode I take you through the process of adding structure using RequireJS. Rather than take you through it in real time (the process of me converting it all would not have made great viewing), I walk you through the code <em>after</em> I've made the changes and explain how it works. </p>

<p>I recommend viewing this in HD in fullscreen for best viewing.</p>
