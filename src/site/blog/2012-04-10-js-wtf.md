A quick fun "JS WTF?" post for you today. If you load up your JavaScript console & enter:

    5 < 4 < 3

You'd be expecting to see `false`, right? However, you'll actually see `true`. **WTF?**

This is actually down to the way JavaScript evaluates this and _operator precedence_. What it sees is:

    (5 < 4) < 3

Which in turn gives

    false < 3

JavaScript then coerces `false` into an integer `0`:

    0 < 3

And zero is indeed less than 3, so we get `true` returned.

Not much learned from this one but it's quite a fun thing to show someone & then explain why. I'll be trying to do a lot of these small "fun" posts as there's a fair few areas of "WTF?" in JavaScript, as we all know.
