intro: 'An example of my git workflow in VSCode with the Magit plugin'
---

Over the next few weeks I'm going to be sharing some videos demonstrating parts
of my workflow in VSCode - from managing changes with git (today's video), to
reviewing pull requests, to running tests, and so on.

Today I want to share the
[Magit plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kahole.magit)
for VSCode. It's based on the Magit plugin in Emacs (which I have not used) and
aims to provide an easy to use interface to manage git changes and commits. I've
found it a really great addition to my workflow and I highly recommend giving it
a go.
