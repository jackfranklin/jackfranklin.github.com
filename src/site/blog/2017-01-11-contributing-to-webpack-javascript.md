title: How to contribute to open source with Webpack
intro: In today's video I'm joined by Sean Larkin from the Webpack team as he talks me through contributing to Webpack. You'll see me write the code, run the tests and open a pull request on Github. If you've ever wondered how to get started contributing to open source, this video should help.

[Webpack](http://github.com/webpack/webpack) is one of the most prominent open source projects in the JavaScript and they are always looking for more people to help contribute back to the project. Speaking from personal experience, it's incredibly daunting to even think about contributing back to such a large project, but in this video we'll demonstrate that it's actually no where near as tricky as you might imagine.

I invited Webpack core team member [Sean Larkin](http://twitter.com/thelarkinn) onto a Google Hangouts session as we paired on contributing to Webpack. You'll see how to:

* Clone Webpack and get it running locally on your machine.
* How to find code in the Webpack repository that's good for a pull request.
* How to run the Webpack tests to ensure your work hasn't broken anything.
* How to run ESLint to ensure you're following the code standards of the project.
* How to open a pull request against Webpack.
* Sean's workflow for reviewing pull requests.

Even if you don't want to contribute directly to Webpack, this video should help you contribute to any open source project that you're interested in.

PS: it's definitely worth making the video fullscreen or viewing [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePdXHF2DfeY&feature=youtu.be) so you can see things more clearly.

[You can find the pull request I opened on GitHub](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/3799). Once again, huge thanks to Sean for taking the time to do the video with me. Happy contributing!
