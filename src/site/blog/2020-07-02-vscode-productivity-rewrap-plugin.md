intro:
  'Formatting code comments and Markdown is so much easier with the rewrap
  plugin!'
---

Over the next few weeks I'm going to be sharing some videos demonstrating parts
of my workflow in VSCode - from managing changes with git (today's video), to
reviewing pull requests, to running tests, and so on.

Today I want to share the
[rewrap plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stkb.rewrap)
for VSCode. It's a fantastic tool for easily wrapping code comments, Git
commits, or Markdown files to a certain line length and I use it _all the time_
when writing documentation in code.
