title: "Screencast: localStorage &amp; Store.js"
---

<p>I am happy to reveal the first screencast on The JavaScript Playground! It's been a long time coming & I hope to do a lot more in the future.</p>

<p>In this screencast I demonstrate localStorage & how to use it, along with the limitations. To get around some of these issues, I show you the brilliant Store.js, which acts as a library around localStorage & provides fallbacks too.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> after doing this screencast, I made a pull request to the Store.js repository, adding <code>store.enabled</code>. This was accepted, so if you wish now to check for <code>store.enabled</code>, you can, without having to do that piece of code I show in the screencast.</p>

<p>Any feedback, questions, etc is always warmly welcomed. I'm still new to screencasting, so hopefully I'll get better as I do more but your thoughts would be great.</p>
