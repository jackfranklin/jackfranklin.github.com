title: "Building an App with Express and Backbone: Part 7"
intro: In part 7 we add another route for viewing an individual book.
---

<p>In this episode we do some refactoring and add a route for viewing a single book's details. We'll swap out views and update the page dynamically, allowing the user to click on a book title to see more information. We'll see how Backbone manages URLs for us and we make sure things work on refresh too.</p>

<p>I recommend viewing this in HD in fullscreen for best viewing.</p>
