title: "A JS Playground Update"
---

JavaScript Playground is now just over one month old, so I thought it would be a good time to write a quick post with some updates about the site.

Firstly, you will have noticed that the last post was a week ago, on the 7th. This can be attributed to the fact that for the next 3 weeks is exam period at University, and I've got 4 exams to take between now & the end of May. This unfortunately takes a lot of my time up which means I haven't been able to write at the usual pace. I hope to publish about once a week for the next few weeks before returning to the more frequent schedule from June onwards. If there's something you'd like to see me cover, I'm always on the look out for ideas.

I also wanted to say thank you to everyone who has tweeted, upvoted, retweeted & so on with links to the blog. In the first month JS Playground served over 50, 000 visits which for me personally is amazing, I never expected that to happen. If you're interested in sponsoring the blog, I'm still looking for someone, so please do get in touch to discuss further.

That's all I wanted to say, just a quick message to explain the slow down in content and also to say thank you to everyone who has helped, and I'm glad that the stuff I'm writing is proving beneficial to so many people.
