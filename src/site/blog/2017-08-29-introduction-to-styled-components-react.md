CSS in JavaScript has been something I've been meaning to explore for a while now; it's also one the questions I get asked most when I talk about my experience with React.

[styled-components][styled-components] by [Glen Maddern][glen] and [Max Stoiber][max] is a library aimed at making it really easy to use CSS in React components (and also supports Preact out of the box). Rather than tackle this post alone, I invited Glen to join me to record an introduction to using styled-components.

A huge thanks to Glen for taking the time to talk to me. His videos on [Frontend Center][front-end-center] are absolutely excellent and I highly recommend subscribing.
