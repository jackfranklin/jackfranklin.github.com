title: "Building an App with Express and Backbone: Part 3"
---

<p>In the <a href="http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2013/02/building-an-app-with-express-and-backbone-part-2">second part of the series</a> we did some refactoring and also created the route for viewing a specific book. Today is a small episode with one main task, the ability for the user to make a POST request with JSON that gets saved as a new book.

	As always the <a href="https://github.com/javascript-playground/express-backbone-library-app">code is on Github</a>, and I highly recommend playing the video in HD so it's clearer to see (I record at my laptop's resolution so everything should be crystal clear).</p>

<p>If you have any questions, leave a comment and I'll either reply with a comment or answer in the next video.</p>

<p>Next time we'll leave Express to one side and start up our Backbone application.</p>
