title: "A Site Update"
---

As some of you will have noticed unfortunately posting has slowed in the past few weeks, and I just wanted to write a quick post to explain why. It's largely been down to starting a new job and moving house to a new city, so everything's been a bit hectic. I am pleased to say it's all settled down now, so I hope to resume posting at least twice a week in the very near future. I've also been occupied with some other JS related projects which are very exciting, but unfortunately I can't say anything just yet.

In other news, I;m looking for your feedback as always on what to write. Some people have told me articles are too long so I will be making an effort to do smaller, more targeted posts alongside longer ones. The list of upcoming topics includes:

* Introduction to Spine.js
* Creating your own NPM / Jam packages
* Testing with Sinon.js
* Watch Me Code Screencasts (working title)
* Angular.js
* Writing Node.js apps with CoffeeScript
* Creating Chrome & Firefox extensions
* Frisby.js

And lots more. As always I'm always looking for suggestions on what you'd like to see written so please do let me know if you have any suggestions.
