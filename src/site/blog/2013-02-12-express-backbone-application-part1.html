title: "Building an App with Express and Backbone: Part 1"
---

<p>
In this series we'll first focus on building a server side application. This will be an Express app, with a MongoDB backing. This will serve us up JSON. Once we've set up all of that side, we'll then switch to the client side, and use Backbone to create the client side application.</p>

<p>The application is based on one we created internally at work, a library app. All of us have lots of technical books in the office, and we wanted a way of keeping track of them, so we built a small internal app that kept track of books, who had borrowed what, and so on. Over the course of 10 or so episodes, we'll build this up</p>
