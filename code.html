            <p>This page lists a number of software projects both old and new that I'm most proud of or I think are interesting.</p>
            <p>Some of these projects are more experimental, and some are more polished products that I created.</p>

            <h2>gulp-load-plugins</h2>
            <p><a href="http://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins">gulp-load-plugins</a> is tool for the GulpJS build system that enables users to easily load their Gulp plugins without having to manually load each one individually.</p>
            <p>In addition, the plugins are lazily evaluated, meaning if the user has 20 plugins not all of them have to be fully loaded if they run a task that depends on just 2 of them.</p>
            <p>This is by far the most successful open source project I've created, with over 500 stars on GitHub and 400k installs per month.</p>

            <h2>The Refactoring Tales</h2>
            <p><a href="http://javascriptplayground.com/the-refactoring-tales/">The Refactoring Tales</a> is a series of articles rewritten and merged into an online book that's freely available. The book looks at teaching some coding principles and software architecture solutions to those who work primarily on smaller projects that are largely frontend focused.</p>
            <p>Whilst the book is unfinished it remains something I'd like to come back and finish. I'm a big believer that software and websites of any size can benefit from focusing on maintainability, whatever scale you're working at, and this book was well received by many in the frontend space who found it perfectly summarised content often only considered relevant by backend developers.</p>

            <h2>Devcast.in</h2>
            <p><a href="http://github.com/jackfranklin/devcastin">devcastin</a> is a Ruby application built using Sinatra, Mongo and Stripe that was to be a screencasting application that allowed users to view and purchase videos that I would record.</p>
            <p>Whilst the site never made it into production, this remains one of the few fully fledged applications I have on my own GitHub profile. I spent a considerable amount of time refactoring and was proud of the thorough suite of tests backing the application's functionality.</p>

            <h2>RemoteDataJS</h2>
            <p><a href="http://github.com/jackfranklin/remote-data-js">RemoteDataJS</a> is a library that makes dealing with remote data (JSON from an API, for example) more robust in JavaScript applications. The RemoteData object wraps both the data and the state of the request, meaning it's impossible for a view to get out of sync with the state of the request, and making it much easier for developers to deal with error states.</p>

            <h2>HTML Dist</h2>
            <p><a href="http://github.com/jackfranklin/html-dist">html-dist</a> is a command line tool aimed at helping people deploying frontend projects to approach their HTML files in a similar way.</p>
            <p>When working on a frontend project in development you'll often have multiple <code>script</code> tags that you bundle into one for production. However, you then need to generate the new HTML file. Keeping these in sync was causing me issues so I wrote html-dist to solve that problem.</p>

            <h2>Elm Statey</h2>
            <p><a href="http://github.com/jackfranklin/elm-statey">elm-statey</a> is a small state machine library written in Elm, a language that I have been learning recently. The library supports creating states, defining allowed transitions between states and guard clauses to prevent incorrect transitions. It's fully documented and published on the Elm package system.</p>
