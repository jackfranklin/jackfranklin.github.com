second_title: Some of my favourite Open Source contributions
---

I am a keen developer and in my spare time I like to contribute to open source projects and also work on my own. Here I've highlighted a couple of my favourite OSS projects. My projects are a mix of languages but usually tend to either be JavaScript or Ruby.

#### nodefetch
[nodefetch](https://github.com/jackfranklin/nodefetch) is a small npm module for quickly downloading libraries via the command line.

#### jQuery Form Validator
My [jQuery Form Validator](https://github.com/jackfranklin/jQuery-Form-Validator) was my attempt at a form validation library using jQuery.

#### Heisenberg
In collaboration with [Ben Howdle](http://github.com/benhowdle) I am working on [Heisenberg](http://github.com/benhowdle/heisenberg), a project designed to be a base starting point for users about to commence on a large JavaScript application.

#### Magna Charta
I worked on the [Magna Charta](https://github.com/alphagov/magna-charta) plugin, a jQuery plugin for turning simple HTML tables into bar charts.

You can find many more projects [on Github](http://github.com/jackfranklin).
