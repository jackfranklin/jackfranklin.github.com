In Summer 2013 I've got a bit of time to work on some fun projects. I've got a few personal projects to work on, but I'd love to see if I can help some other people out. Here's the sort of thing I'd like to be doing, either remotely or in person depending on locations. I'm open to travelling.

- Working with Node. I like writing Node plugins and applications in Node. If you're up to that, maybe I can help out.
- Training. I've run a variety of workshops and presentations before on a number of topics and I'd like to do more.
- BackboneJS. Enough said. I really enjoy working with Backbone and would love to find a nice Backbone application project to get stuck into.
- Writing. I've written a book on jQuery, contributed to an O'Reilly book and written for numerous publications. Maybe I can write for yours too?
- Consulting. If you'd like some advice, someone to ask some JavaScript questions to, or to code-review something, let me know.

If any of this sounds interesting, please drop me an email: jack at jackfranklin dot net. I'd be happy to chat further either via email, Skype or even in person if you happen to be in London.
